# $dom_component
Subrepository for [jaandrle/jaaJSU ($dom namespace)](https://github.com/jaandrle/jaaJSU).

## Overview
This library provide ability to write HTML/DOM components without using _OPP/class_ syntax and _jsx_.

The main reasons for another library like [React](https://reactjs.org/) are
1. React is too complex for __some__ user cases: this is solved for example by [litedom](https://github.com/mardix/litedom).

    a) In some user cases, it is not neccessary to defined `onDidMount`, â€¦ events.
1. You want using Vanilla JavaScript syntax as much as is possible: this is solved by JS itsel see [webcomponents](https://www.webcomponents.org).
1. You don't need virtual DOM: this is solved for example by [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).

    a) In some user cases, it can be quicker to complementy remove component with old state and create it again instead of updating some properties.

    a) You know changes because of another part of you app (e. g. API) are able to provide only changes.
1. You prefer functional way of programming: this is solved for example by [h0](https://github.com/jxnblk/h0), [rdom](https://github.com/buzzdecafe/rdom), [fp-dom](https://github.com/fp-dom/fp-dom).
1. __Previous point(s) + you would like avoid recurion call: this is solved by this lib__
